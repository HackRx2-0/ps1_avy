_Front-end :_ We will create a web app based on ReactJs, in which we will request user input and send that input keyword to server through Rest Api, and then server will send that relevant data, then we will showcase that data to user in a nice, clean, user friendly and responsive interface. So that the user will be satisfied from the result.
