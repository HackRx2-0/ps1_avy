## This folder contains the files related to the website search's backend.

_Back-end :_ We will create a Restful Api (server), in which the server will retrieve user input as a string (The word that has been searched) from the front-end and then the server will search that keywords in mongoDB and then it will send the JSON data to the client (frontend).
